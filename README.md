# MetaLearningofSegmentation
My research in Master degree, I try to combine meta learning algorithms with FCN in order to improve the performance of FCN in image segmentation. In the research and experience, we found that Meta Learning`s performance will be better when we use the repetitive sampling in the few data situstion.
